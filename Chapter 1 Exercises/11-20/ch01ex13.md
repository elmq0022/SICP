Prove that Fib(n) is the closest integer to fi^n/sqrt(5)

where fi = (1 + sqrt(5))/2.

*Hint*: Let phi = (1-sqrt(5))/2.  Use induction and the definition of 

the Fibonacci numbers to prove that Fib(n) = (fi^n - phi^n)/sqrt(5)

#Solution
Follow the hint and use induction.

Does Fib(0) hold?

Yes fi - phi = 0

Does Fib(1) hold?

Yes fi - phi = 1 

Does the induction hold?

Fib(n-2) + Fib(n-1) = Fib(n)

fi^(n-2) + fi^(n-1) - phi^(n-2) - phi^(n-1)

fi^n (fi^-2 + fi^-1) - phi^n (phi^-2 + phi^-1)

Simple algebra shows that 

(fi^-2 + fi^-1) = 1

(phi^-2 + phi^-1) = 1

So yes, the hint portion of this problem is proven.  

Since 0 < phi < 1, Fib(n) is bound from above by fi^n and Fib(n)
is the closest integer to fi^n.
